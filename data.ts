    chapter: "1.5 Production possibility curves",
    maxMarks: 8,
    questionText: "With the help of a diagram, explain the difference between the causes of a movement along, and a shift of, a production possibility curve (PPC) and consider which is likely to have the most immediate impact on an economy.",
    markScheme: `AO1 (3 marks): An understanding of a PPC shown through an accurate diagram, with correctly labelled axes (1), a movement along a PPC showing a trade-off between production on the two axes (1), and a shift of a PPC showing an increase in production of two goods with no trade-off (1).
AO2 (3 marks): Uses the PPC to explain that a movement along a PPC is caused by a reallocation of resources (1), as resources are shifted between the two types of product, involving an opportunity cost (1), but a shift of a PPC is caused by an increase in the quantity and/or quality of resources, allowing more of both goods to be produced (1).
AO3 (2 marks): Offers a valid judgement on whether a movement along, or a shift of, a PPC is likely to have the most immediate impact on an economy (1) to reach a conclusion (1).`
